            In 1922 a larger expedition returned. They brought oxygen with them this time, but the equipment
            was very heavy, and it did not always work. Many of the climbers wanted to climb the mountain on their
            own, if possible, without help. So climbing with oxygen was not popular with most of the climbers.</p>
        <p>
            Four climbers set out on the first summit attempt - Mallory, Morshead, Norton, and Somervell.
            With five porters, they left Camp 4 on the North Col at 7.00 a.m. There was a terrible cold wind, and
            the
            climbers moved slowly, cutting steps in the snow for the porters behind them. They hoped to reach 8,230
            metres that day, but at 7,620 metres they were too cold and tired to go on. They found a place for Camp
            5
            and the porters left their loads here and went back down.</p>
        <p>
            The four men crawled into their two small tents to rest. But all night there was a high wind, and it
            was difficult to breathe or sleep. To get water to drink, they had to melt snow over a small cooker,
            which
            took a long time.</p>
        <p>
            Next morning, Morshead was ill. So Mallory, Norton, and Somervell set out at 8.00 a.m., leaving
            Morshead alone in the tent. They moved slowly, stopping after every few steps to rest and breathe. As
            they climbed, their hobnail boots slipped dangerously on the stones and rocks. In the thin air they felt
            tired, more tired than any of them had ever felt before. At 2.00 p.m. they reached 8,227 metres, but
            they
            were still about 600 metres below the summit. So they turned back, and helped Morshead down to Camp
            3.</p>
